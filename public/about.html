<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello!<br>
My name is Anamarija and I am 29.<br />
After being a survey engineer for years I decided to change my career in another direction.<br />
I have always loved math and I have always loved solving different kins of problems,<br />
like enigma, sudoku etc.

<p>I love reading books on weekens, enjoying booze by the coast and I am big movie fan</p>

<p>Except the programming I like dancing, interior designing etc.</p>
